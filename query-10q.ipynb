For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify\\nthe USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and\\ndisadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address\\nconcerns and regulation relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in\\nour products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\\nITEM 2.

These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\\nsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End\\nCustomers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to\\nCustomer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue\\nfor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these\\nchannel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\\nour products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in\\nsupport of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third\\nquarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and\\n10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily\\nattributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain\\nconcentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple\\noriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand\\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners\\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large\\ncustomers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or\\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\\nactions may adversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business\\nacquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\\n41', metadata={'page': 40.0, 'source': 'Documents\\\\tesla-q3.pdf'}), Document(page_content='•stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\\nunable to close an acquisition;\\n•potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\\ncovenants or other restrictions;\\n•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\\n•the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\\n•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\\n•exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\\n•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\\nsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End\\nCustomers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to\\nCustomer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue\\nfor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these\\nchannel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\\nour products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in\\nsupport of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third\\nquarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and\\n10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily\\nattributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain\\nconcentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple\\noriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand\\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners\\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue.
